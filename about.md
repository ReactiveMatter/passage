Passage is a PHP based static site generator. It is highly customizable and easy. It uses PHP for creating templates, hence no need to learn a new templating language (as PHP itself is a templating language).

It uses Parsedown and Symphony YAML component to generate static html files.

Note: This is a static page, and hence will not appear in blog.
